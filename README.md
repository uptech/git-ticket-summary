# Git Ticket Summary

This repository houses the source code for the Git Ticket Summary command line
tool.

It is a tool that runs through a Git repository and gathers & presents all the
commits associated with a given ticket identifier and presents them as well as
all the files touched by those commits.

It currently also generates GitHub links to the commits so that people can go
to them and comment inline on the code to provide feedback.

Beyond that it provides links to all of the touch files using the currently
checked out branch. This is useful to gain further context around if & how the
code has progressed since the commits happened.
